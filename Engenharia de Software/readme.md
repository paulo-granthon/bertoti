We see three critical differences between programming and software engineering: time, scale, and the trade-offs at play.
On a software engineering project, engineers need to be more concerned with the passage of time and the eventual need for change.
In a software engineering organization, we need to be more concerned about scale and efficiency, both for the software we produce as well as for the organization that is producing it.
Finally, as software engineers, we are asked to make more complex decisions with higher-stakes outcomes, often based on imprecise estimates of time and growth.

  Programing by itself, compared software engineering, it's more of a standalone skill or tool that can be used to reach some objective, being a simple single-use configuration .bat script to run once in your machine, or an entire application or game alongside other tools as a software engineer.  
  The text highlights some of the differences between the "programing" tool or skill and the "software engineering" role / job.
